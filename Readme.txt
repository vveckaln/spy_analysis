Repository for tauDilepton analysis
-----------------------------------
* This is the manual. Read the fucking manual +BEFORE+ running the code.

* For help: pietro.vischia atPlzNoSpam gmail.com / pietro.vischia atPlzNoSpam cern.ch

* Will work for ttbar cross section measurement as well as charged higgs search/tau polarization

* This started as a porting to a compiled binary approach like LIP/Top, in order
to remove levels of messiness in the original code to be compiled every time together with
its libraries - whoah running time is already 1/2 than before, LoL

* MOVED TO GITHUB.COM ON APRIL 30th, 2013 because of CERN CVS service shutdown

Instructions for running analysis
---------------------------------

# Local pattuple test run (local data file at LIP)
# obsolete, must update: cmsRun LIP/TopTaus/test/createDataPattuple_cfg.py /lustre/data3/cmslocal/samples/CMSSW_5_2_5/test/Run2012B_SingleMu_AOD_PromptReco-v1_000_193_998_0C7DCC80-4E9D-E111-B22A-001D09F25267.root pattuple.root inclusive_mu


Finding HLT trigger on a per-run-range basis, together with the prescale
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ssh lxplus.cern.ch # needed for access to database
cvs co HLTrigger/Tools/python
scram b
cd HLTrigger/Tools/python
source $CMSSW_BASE/LIP/TopTaus/scripts/getTriggers.sh
This will fetch the list of triggers, and depending on what you comment will print or not the prescales table. (see TODO list)


Multiple likelihood fit for improving tau fakes uncertainty
-----------------------------------------------------------
runTauDileptonPDFBuilderFitter tauDileptonAnalysisParSets_cfg.py

Relevant parameters: straightforward cfg file. Must write doc here, though

Produce shapes:
---------------
produceLandSShapes tauDileptonAnalysisParSets_cfg.py --produceOnly (true|false [false])

Relevant parameters: straightforward cfg file.
Command options: 
- produceOnly: (necessary because in plots HH and WH are rescaled, in rootfile not)
               in TBH won't be necessary,  so fuck it.
	       -True: just produces rootfile with all the shapes, no plot.
	       -False: [default] just produces plots, no rootfile.

Run physicsAnalysis - this corresponds to the obsolete PhysicsAnalyzer code
------------------------------------------------------------------
- interactively:
  physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py sample
  (where "sample" is ttbar, wjets, etc. Strings can be found in bin/physicsAnalysis.cc)
- on the LIP batch:
  cd scripts/lip-batch/
  sh combineResults.sh path/to/dir clean --> this cleans the output directory in which you want to store the outputs	
  EDIT submit-jobs.sh in order to change the script path to your local installation.
  EDIT the *output* paths in test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py . The input are fixed (53X production)
  sh submit-jobs.sh
  qstat -u username --> this checks whether your jobs are running and if they did already finish
  sh combineResults.sh path/to/dir hadd [AB|ABC|ABCD] --> this hadds the relevant output files
  RUN physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py doPlots   ---> this produces plots
  RUN physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py doTables  ---> this produces tables and datacards (if "higgs" is turned on)
- have fun

Produce plots
-------------
cd LIP/TopTaus  # this is necessary, because at the moment bin/physicsAnalysis.cc is configured
                # in such a way as to fetch plots from "data/plotter/". Must change to configurable paths via cfg file
mkdir plots
physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py doPlots

Produce tables
--------------
physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py doTables 
                datacards are not produced, and tbh yields are rescaled to the production cross section of the tbh samples (1.1pb)
physicsAnalysis test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py doDatacards 
		datacards are produced, and tbh yields are rescaled to the ttbar production cross-section
		

Produce fakerate
----------------
for a list of all the options:
    doTauFakesStudy test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py --help 
for running everything:
    doTauFakesStudy test/physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py --do all

Plot signal cut efficiencies

rev 702 (2012-04-18): first counting-only chiggs datacards for heavy charged higgs


TODO:
- clean and update TODO list ;)
- change the interface to FitVar class (constructor) in the whole code (for now, additional fancyName for the variable is set after calling costructor)
- add comp plots for fakes
- fix uncertainty band plotting in case the plot is normalized to 1 (Rtau)
- update tau ID uncertainties
- update uncertainties in HistogramPlotter
- move to txt file the cout of the fakes computation in TauFakesHelper.cc (latex table and everything)
- reweight MC distros con q/g fraction evaluated from MC
- From my 2013-04-22 presentation at TauPOG: recalculate fakes feeding the wmu sample the qcd mva and vice versa, try training with more kinematical variables
- move all 234.s in the code (TauDileptonTableBuilder in particular) to the value from SampleProcessor (or move the xsecs to CommonDefinitions, better) 
- vstrings in physicsAnalysisParSets_cfg.py for pileup syst
- move path of plots output directory to command line or cfg file.
- split JEC uncertainty sources into the 16 components.
- scripts/getTriggers.hs: implement running through sh getTriggers.sh PARS, in order to allow to choose
  at runtime whether to print the prescales table or just the triggers

- Make the unbinned fit work, caralho

- Apply single RooDataset per sample to LandSShapesProducer too

- Rework of LandSShapesProducer and PDFBuilderFitter
  --> New structure: -> single class for building datasets and models
                     -> one inheriting class for shapes production, storing and plotting (LandSShapesProducer)
		     -> one inheriting class for fitting, saving and plotting (PDFBuilderFitter)
		     -> perhaps one single executable with switch via ParSet in config file

- Pattuple producer 
  --> Acquire and improve version from 2013-01-23 - must upload from lipcms svn - in order to use
      multicrab in the future

- Ntuples producer --> Convert plugin

- Analysis code:
                 --> move hardcoded parameters to configuration file via edm::ParameterSet (minimize the need for recompiling)
		 --> import batch submission and modify process in order to run on a given subset of events.
		     (add s.th like void processEvents(uint firstEv, uint lastEv, string dataset){ if(string...) CutflowAnalyzer::process_ttbar(.. process(firstEv, lastEv) ..)  }
		     Doing that needs to redefine the total number of events in the event reweighting according to xsec and N_mc_evts
- Tau energy scale for main analysis code. 

- Split fake contribution into e and mu
  --> Evan/Monica 2013-01-23: "there are different scale factors for e and mu fakes to be applied,
      so you better split the two components in the cutflow yields table"

- Fix crash after natural end when running interactively (low priority)
